# Neural Network Regression

Neural-network regression to find best network configuration.

---

## About

This project demonstrates the implementation of neural-network regression using three datasets - a custom 'toy' dataset, automobile dataset and Anuran calls dataset.

This project was implemented as a part of the CS445: Introduction to Machine Learning course at Colorado State University, during the Spring of 2018.  

### Built With

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
